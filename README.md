## Project Scope
The scope of 10xCards includes:
- A robust and scalable card management system.
- Responsive and dynamic user interfaces.
- Core features such as card creation, editing, organization, and sharing.
- Potential integration of user authentication and real-time collaboration.
- An architecture designed for continuous development and future feature enhancements.

## OpenRouter Service
The application includes an OpenRouter service for AI-powered features. The service is implemented in `src/lib/services/openrouter.service.ts` and provides the following functionality:

### Configuration
```typescript
const config: OpenRouterConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
  baseUrl: process.env.OPENROUTER_BASE_URL,
  defaultModel: process.env.OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_MODEL,
  defaultParams: {
    parameter: 1.0,
    top_p: 1.0,
    frequency_penalty: 0.0,
    presence_penalty: 0.0
  }
};
```

### Usage
```typescript
const openRouter = new OpenRouterService(config);

// Basic chat completion
const response = await openRouter.chat(
  "You are a helpful assistant",
  "What is the capital of France?"
);

// With custom parameters
const response = await openRouter.chat(
  "You are a helpful assistant",
  "What is the capital of France?",
  {
    model: "openai/gpt-4",
    parameter: 0.7,
    response_format: {
      type: "json_schema",
      json_schema: {
        name: "capital_response",
        strict: true,
        schema: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            capital: { type: "string" },
            country: { type: "string" }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
);
```

### Error Handling
The service includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Network errors (`NetworkError`)
- API errors (`ApiError`)
- Validation errors (`ValidationError`)

All errors include descriptive messages and appropriate error codes where applicable.

### Retry Mechanism
The service implements an exponential backoff retry mechanism with jitter for handling transient failures:
- Maximum 3 retry attempts
- Initial delay of 1 second
- Maximum delay of 10 seconds
- Random jitter (Â±100ms) to prevent thundering herd

## Project Status
The 10xCards application is currently under active development. Ongoing updates and new features are being implemented to improve functionality and user experience.
