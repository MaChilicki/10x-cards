# 10xCards App

## Project Description
10xCards is a cutting-edge card management application designed to simplify the creation, management, and sharing of digital cards. Built with modern technologies, the project aims to deliver a fast, scalable, and user-friendly experience suitable for both personal and professional use.

## Tech Stack
- **Astro 5**: A modern static site generator for building fast websites.
- **TypeScript 5**: Enhances code quality and maintainability with static type-checking.
- **React 19**: Powers dynamic user interfaces with interactive components.
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Provides utility-first styling for rapid UI development.
- **Shadcn/ui**: Offers a consistent set of pre-designed UI components.
- **Node**: Version specified in the `.nvmrc` file for compatibility.

## Environment Variables Summary
To run the project locally, you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables. See respective sections for more details on obtaining these values.

-   `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your API key for OpenRouter.
-   `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`: (Optional) The base URL for the OpenRouter API (defaults to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`).
-   `OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_MODEL`: The default LLM for AI features (e.g., `openai/gpt-4.1`).
-   `SUPABASE_URL`: URL for your local or remote Supabase instance.
-   `SUPABASE_KEY`: Anon key for your local or remote Supabase instance.
-   `E2E_USERNAME_ID` (for E2E tests): Test user ID.
-   `E2E_USERNAME` (for E2E tests): Test user email.
-   `E2E_PASSWORD` (for E2E tests): Test user password.

## Getting Started Locally
To run 10xCards on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaChilicki/10xCards.git
   cd 10xCards
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Ensure you are using the correct Node version:**
   Check the `.nvmrc` file for the required Node version.
4. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project (refer to "Environment Variables Summary" above and specific sections for details on OpenRouter and Supabase).
   ```bash
   # .env example
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key

   # Variables for E2E tests (optional for basic local development)
   E2E_USERNAME_ID=test_user_id_example
   E2E_USERNAME=test@example.com
   E2E_PASSWORD=securepassword123
   ```
5. **Set up and start the local Supabase instance** (see "Supabase Database Setup" section below).
6. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

-   `./src/db`: Supabase client setup and database type definitions.
-   `./src/middleware`: Astro middleware.
-   `./public`: Static assets directly served.
-   `./supabase/migrations`: Database migration files.
(For detailed project structure guidelines, please refer to internal project documentation.)

## Application Features

- **Flashcard Management**:
    - Automatic AI-powered flashcard generation from text (using LLM via OpenRouter).
    - Manual creation, editing, and deletion of flashcards.
    - Approval process for AI-generated flashcards.
    - Indication of flashcard source (AI or manual).
- **Content Organization**:
    - Hierarchical structure: Topics -> Documents -> Flashcards.
    - CRUD operations for topics.
    - CRUD operations for documents, including adding source content for flashcards.
- **User Authentication**:
    - User registration, login, and session management (via Supabase Auth).
- **Learning and Review System** (Planned Feature):
    - A spaced repetition system for effective learning is planned for future implementation. This feature is not yet available.

## Development Environment Setup

### Supabase Database Setup

For local development using the Supabase CLI:
1. **Install Supabase CLI**: Follow the [official documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).
2. **Log in to Supabase CLI**:
   ```bash
   supabase login
   ```
3. **Link to a Supabase project (optional, if you have a remote project for reference)**:
   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
   ```
   Find `YOUR_PROJECT_REF` in your Supabase project dashboard.
4. **Start the local Supabase instance**:
   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```
   This will start local Supabase services, including a Postgres database. Access credentials (URL, anon key, service_role key) will be displayed in the console. Copy the URL and anon key to your `.env` file.
5. **Apply migrations and seed data**:
    - Migrations in the `supabase/migrations` directory are automatically applied when you first run `supabase start`.
    - To reset the local database and re-apply all migrations and seed data from `supabase/seed.sql`:
        ```bash
        supabase db reset
        ```
    - To apply only the latest migrations to an existing local database:
        ```bash
        supabase migration up # Preferred command as of Supabase CLI v1.160.0+
        # or `supabase db push` for older versions or specific use cases
        ```

### AI-Powered Flashcard Generation (OpenRouter)

The application uses OpenRouter for AI-assisted flashcard generation. This functionality is primarily located in `src/lib/services/ai-generate.service.ts`, which utilizes a system prompt defined in `src/lib/prompts/generate-flashcards.md`.

**Configuration:**

AI features are configured via environment variables in your `.env` file (see "Environment Variables Summary" section).

**Changing the LLM Model:**

- The primary way to change the model is by updating the `OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_MODEL` environment variable.
- The model can also be overridden dynamically within the `OpenRouterService` if specific calls require a different model, though changing the environment variable is the standard approach for setting the default.

### Unit Testing (Vitest)
The project uses Vitest for unit testing.
- **Running tests**:
  ```bash
  npm run test # Runs all unit tests
  npm run test:watch # Runs tests in watch mode
  npm run test:coverage # Runs tests and generates a coverage report
  npm run test:ui # Runs tests in UI mode (if configured)
  ```
- **Structure**: Unit tests are located in the `tests/unit/` directory. They cover services, API endpoints, and frontend components.

### End-to-End Testing (Playwright)
The project uses Playwright for E2E tests.
- **Running tests**:
  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e # Runs all E2E tests
  npm run test:e2e:ui # Runs E2E tests in UI mode
  npm run test:e2e:debug # Runs E2E tests in debug mode
  npm run test:e2e:report # Displays the E2E test report
  ```
- **Structure**: E2E tests are in the `tests/e2e/` directory and use the Page Object Model (POM) pattern. Scenarios cover key user flows like login and content management.

## CI/CD Automation (GitHub Actions)

The CI/CD process is automated using GitHub Actions (defined in `.github/workflows/pull-request.yml`). The workflow, triggered on every Pull Request to `main`, performs the following:
- **Code Linting**.
- **Unit Testing** with code coverage reporting.
- **End-to-End Testing** (Playwright).
- **Posts a comment** on the PR summarizing test results and code coverage.

## Deployment
The application is built as a Node.js server using `npm run build`. To deploy:
1. Build the application: `npm run build`. This will create a `dist/` directory.
2. The `dist/server/entry.mjs` file is the entry point for the Node.js server.
3. Deploy the contents of the `dist/` directory (or just the server and client subdirectories if preferred) to a Node.js compatible hosting environment (e.g., a VPS, PaaS like Heroku, or serverless functions if adapted).
4. Ensure all necessary environment variables (see "Environment Variables Summary") are set in your deployment environment.
5. Start the server using `node dist/server/entry.mjs`.

Astro also supports various adapters for other deployment targets (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Deno). Refer to the [Astro documentation on SSR adapters](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#configure-an-adapter) if you wish to use a different deployment strategy.
